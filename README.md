## James Quilter

I am a former journalist and content marketer specialising in sectors as diverse as advertising agencies to wind turbines. Previous companies include Twitter and Haymarket Business Publishing. However, as great as all of this was, I just love to writing software applications. So, as a result, I am set to learn to code at Makers Academy. 

## Skills

#### Analysis

During my journalistic career I developed an ability to understand and simplify complex ideas and stories and convey them to a specific audience. A good example of this is Windpower Monthly magazine, which I joined without any experience of knowledge of the renewable energy and wind turbine engineering. Within weeks I was able to understand and create content for a highly knowledeable audience.

- Experience - Marketing Magazine, Brand Republic, Windpower Monthly.
- Achievements - Launched Windpowermonthly.com, which was nominated as Best Business Magazine Site by the Periodical Publishers Association in 2013. 

#### Creativity

A key strength is the ability to solve problems creatively. A good example of this was during my time at Twitter where I ran the World Cup 2018 B2B marketing campaign for EMEA. In journalism, I worked with the sales team to create revenue driving products and introduced live video to events while at Windpower Monthly. 

- Windpower Monthly: launched site and built it up to the biggest worldwide wind energy site within a year.
- Created features ideas and supplements. Other examples include introducing live video from events. 
- Produced Javascript-based applications for viewing complex data. 

#### Management

During my journalistic career I worked up from reporter on a print title to building and editing online titles. Frequently, this involved collaborating with the engineering teams, as well as sales, events and other areas of the company. Separately, I have also been responsible for training and bringing through new reporters on the team, and managing external correspondents.
