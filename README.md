[Journalism](#journalism) | [Creativity](#creativity) | 

I am a former journalist and content marketer specialising in sectors as diverse as advertising agencies to wind turbines. Previous companies include Twitter and Haymarket Business Publishing. However, as great as all of this was, I just love to writing software applications. So, as a result, I am set to learn to code at Makers Academy. 

## Skills

#### <a name="journalism">Writing, Editing, and Journalism</a>

Throughout my career, I have consistently worked with other teams - sales, editors, external partners and subjects - to produce quality content and journalism. This has required teamwork as well as individual application. 

- Experience - Marketing Magazine, Brand Republic, Windpower Monthly.
- Sectors - Energy, Retail, Media, Finance, and Automotive.
- Achievements - Launched Windpowermonthly.com, which was nominated as Best Business Magazine Site by the Periodical Publishers Association in 2013. 

#### <a name="creatvity">Creativity</a>

An ability to solve creative challenges. A good example of this was during my time at Twitter where I ran the World Cup 2018 B2B marketing campaign for EMEA. In journalism, I worked with the sales team to create revenue driving products such as the introduction of live video to events while at Windpower Monthly. 

- Windpower Monthly: launched site and built it up to the biggest worldwide wind energy site within a year.
- Created features ideas and supplements. Other examples include introducing live video from events. 
- Produced Javascript-based applications for viewing complex data. 

#### Management

During my journalistic career I worked up from reporter on a print title to building and editing online titles. Frequently, this involved collaborating with the engineering teams, as well as sales, events and other areas of the company. Separately, I have also been responsible for training and bringing through new reporters on the team, and managing external correspondents.
